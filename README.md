# The effects of temperature variation on the distribution of rock pool predators and their prey
Contains data and models describing rock pool temperature variation and its relationship with the abundance of mosquito larvae and their dragonfly nymph predators at Belle Isle, Richmond VA.

The directory "abundance" contains data and code used to model the distribution and abundance of Ae. atropalpus mosquito larvae as a function of predatory dragonfly nymphs (Pantala spp.) and predicted rock pool temperatures.

The directory "figs" contains code and figures used to describe the temperature and abundance models.

The directory "pantala" contains data and code used to fit temperature-dependent functional response models, describing Pantala spp. dragonfly nymphs feeding rates on Ae. atropalpus mosquito larval prey.

The directory "temperature" contains data and code used to model the thermal environment of riverine rock pools as a function of their abiotic characteristics, as well as predicted maximum temperatures for the full rock pool landscape at our field site.
